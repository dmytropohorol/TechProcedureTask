# TechProcedureTask

Hi, I created a wall with a window actor using the UProcedureMeshComponent in C++, and a BP child of it with the "Create Mesh" function in its construction script. It works in an editor, and you can specify not only positions and sizes but also the size of UVs. I will be grateful for any fixes or optimizations to my code.
